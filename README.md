# Space game (discontinued)
This is a engine written in JS for Browsers, it is not finished. It has an interesting "compiling" mechanic, which is pretty much dumb. It needs PHP installed on the machine to run the compiling script. I've already compiled it for your convinience so you don't have to.

To be honest, I don't know how far I got with this. I fixed it so it atleast runs in Firefox, chrome doesn't allow for ajax request in "file://"-context.

## "Compile" the source
You need PHP for this. Then run:
```
php compile.php
```
Then open index.html, you're done.

## Controls
Arrow Keys: Move around.

Mouse: Use menues
